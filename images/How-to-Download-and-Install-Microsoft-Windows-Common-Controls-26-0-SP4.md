## Step 1: Download Microsoft Windows Common Controls 2.6 0 SP4
 
The first step is to download the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Common Controls package from the official Microsoft Download Center[^1^].

You can choose your preferred language from the drop-down menu and then click on the Download button.
 
Alternatively, you can use this direct link[^2^] to download the package as a CAB file. You will need to extract the files from the CAB file using a tool such as WinZip or 7-Zip.

The next step is to install the common controls on your system. To do this, you need to register the files mscomctl.ocx and comctl32.ocx using the regsvr32 command. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open a command prompt as an administrator. To do this, press the Windows key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin) or Windows PowerShell (Admin) from the menu.
2. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded or extracted the common controls files. For example, if you downloaded them to your Downloads folder, type `cd %userprofile%\Downloads` and press Enter.
3. Type `regsvr32 mscomctl.ocx` and press Enter. You should see a message saying that the registration was successful.
4. Type `regsvr32 comctl32.ocx` and press Enter. You should see a similar message.

## Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you still encounter problems with the common controls after installing them, here are some possible solutions:

- Make sure that you have installed all the latest updates for your Windows and Office versions. You can check for updates by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update or by opening any Office application and clicking on File > Account > Update Options > Update Now.
- If you are using Excel 2007 or later, you may need to apply a corrective patch[^3^] that fixes an issue with the MonthView control. You can download and run this patch from the Microsoft Support website.
- If you are using Excel 2013 or later, you may need to enable IE mode in Microsoft Edge[^1^] to load Internet Explorer sites that use ActiveX controls. To do this, go to Settings > Default browser > Internet Explorer compatibility > Allow sites to be reloaded in Internet Explorer mode and turn on the toggle switch.
- If none of these solutions work for you, you may need to contact Microsoft Support or post your question on the TechNet forum for further assistance.
